** Using the R-DCOM Server with LabVIEW:

1.  Insert an "Automation Open" function on the block diagram
(Functions Palette:  Communication  >> ActiveX >> Automation Open)

2.  Using the wiring utility cursor, right click on the "Automation
Refnum" input on the "Automation Open" function and go to "Select
ActiveX Class >> Browse" to open the "Select Object from Type Library"
dialog box.   

3.  Select "StatConnectorSrv 1.1" from the "Type Library" drop-down
menu.

4.  Wire the "Automation Refnum" output on the "Automation Open"
function to the "reference" input of an "Invoke Node" function.  Set
the method to "Init."  Set the input to "Init" as "R".

5.  Wire the "reference" output of the first "Invoke Node" function to
the "reference" input of a second "Invoke Node" function.  Set the
method to "Evaluate".  Create a string control as the input to
"Evaluate".  Wire the output of "Evaluate" to the "Variant" input of a
"Variant to Data" function.

6.  Wire the "type" input of the "Variant to Data" function to a
string control.  Wire the "data" output of the "Variant to Data"
function to a string indicator. 

7.  Wire the "reference" output of the second "Invoke Node" function
to the "reference" input of a third "Invoke Node" function.  Set the
method to "Close".  

8.  Wire the "reference" output of the third "Invoke Node" function to
the "Automation Refnum" input of an "Automation Close" function.

9.  The resulting VI will evaluate any expression inserted in the
"Evaluate" string input control.
