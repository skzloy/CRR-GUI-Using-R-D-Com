\section{Introduction}

\begin{quotation}
Let us change or traditional attitude to the construction of programs.
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a \emph{computer}
what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to \emph{humans}
what we want the computer to do.  (Donald E. Knuth, 1984).
\end{quotation}

This is the definition of a coding style called \emph{literate programming}.
I first made use of it in the \emph{coxme} library and have become a full
convert.  For the survival library only selected objects are documented in
this way; whenever I find need for a major revision.  
An underlying motivation is to leave code that is well enough explained that
someone else can take it over.
