 Some portions of the survival package have been written using the literate
programming paradym.  These are contained here, and have a .Rnw suffix.
Long term, the plan is to have all of the code source here to maximize
the documentation, and through it the reliability of the package.  At
this time the number of files here is very small, so I have broken one of
the rules of archiving, "put only the oringinal source under version
control"; the .R files that result from these source documents are also
kept in ../../R.  

These files are NOT intended for processing by Sweave.  The function of Sweave
is to execute R fragments, interspersing code and results.  The purpose of
this material is to create the .R source code and a detailed latex commentary
on that code.  In particular, Sweave cannot reassemble a named chunk of
code from scattered fragments.  The latter is one of the main advantages
of the noweb system: you can organise the presentation for optimal explanation
rather than in exectuion order.

The result file all.pdf is documentation for understanding the code, 
not how to use the survival functions for data analysis.  For those who
maintain the code it should be a big help, for everyone else I'd expect
it to be boring.

It would be nice if Rtangle could be used to extract the code since that would
make the library self contained for compilation purposes.  Que sera sera.

The .Rnw suffix causes emacs work perfectly for either a noweb or Sweave 
target, however, which is very nice.
