1 Introduction
**************

This FAQ is for the Windows port of R: it describes features specific to
that version.  The main R FAQ can be found at

     `http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html'.

The information here applies only to recent versions of R for Windows,
(`2.10.0' or later).  It is mainly about the 32-bit build, with some
mentions of 64-bit builds (only relevant to `2.11.0' or later).


2 Installation and Usage
************************

2.1 Where can I find the latest version?
========================================

Go to any CRAN site (see `http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html' for a
list), navigate to the `bin/windows/base' directory and collect the
file(s) you need.  The current release is distributed as an installer
`R-2.11.1-win32.exe' of about 32Mb.  This contains all the components
and allows as complete as installation as you choose.

There are also links on that page to the `r-patched' and `r-devel'
snapshots.  These are frequently updated builds of development versions
of R.  The `r-patched' build includes bug fixes to the current release,
and `r-devel' contains these as well as changes that will eventually
make it into the next `x.y.0' release.

2.2 How do I install R for Windows?
===================================

Current binary versions of R run on Windows 2000 or later.(1), including
on 64-bit versions: *Note Can I use R on 64-bit Windows?::.

We only test on versions of Windows currently supported by Microsoft,
mainly on 32-bit XP SP3 and 64-bit Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.

Your file system must allow case-honouring long file names (as is likely
except perhaps for some network-mounted systems).  A typical install
takes 45Mb of disk space, a full installation about 65Mb and a minimal
one about 29Mb.

If you want to be able to build packages from sources, we recommend that
you choose an installation path not containing spaces.  (Using a path
with spaces in will probably work, but is little-tested.)  Users of
Vista/Windows 7/Server 2008 installing for a single user using an
account with administrator rights(2) should consider installing into a
non-system area (such as `C:\R').  Installing to a network share (a
filepath starting with `\\machine\...') is not supported: such paths
will need to mapped to a network drive.

To install use `R-2.11.1-win32.exe'.  Just double-click on the icon and
follow the instructions.  If you have an account with Administrator
privileges you will be able to install R in the `Program Files' area
and to set all the optional registry entries; otherwise you will only
be able to install R in your own file area.  On recent versions of
Windows you may need to confirm that you want to proceed with installing
a program from an `unidentified publisher'.

After installation you should choose a working directory for R.  You
will have a shortcut to `R-2.11.1\bin\Rgui.exe' on your desktop and/or
somewhere on the Start menu file tree, and perhaps also in the Quick
Launch part of the taskbar.  Right-click each shortcut, select
Properties... and change the `Start in' field to your working directory.

You may also want to add command-line arguments at the end of the
Target field (_after_ any final double quote, and separated by a
space), for example `--sdi --max-mem-size=1G'.  You can also set
environment variables at the end of the Target field, for example
`R_LIBS=p:/myRlib', and if you want to ensure that menus and messages
are in (American) English, `LANGUAGE=en'.

It is also possible (32-bit only) to install from an MSI file, which
will be of interest only for system administrators.  For how to build an
MSI file, see the `R Installation and Administration Manual'.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) R 2.6.2 was the last version for Windows 95. 98, ME and NT4.

(2) Non-administrator accounts will automatically be offered a default
installation directory in the user area.

2.3 How do I check an installation is not corrupt?
==================================================

Relates to earlier installers, removed in R 2.11.0.

2.4 Can I customize the installation?
=====================================

The normal way to customize the installation is by selecting components
from the wizards shown by the installer.  However, sysadmins might like
to install R from scripts, and the following command-line flags are
available for use with the installer.

`/SILENT'
     only show the installation progress window and error messages.

`/VERYSILENT'
     only show error messages.

`/DIR="x:\dirname"'
     set the default installation directory

`/GROUP="folder name"'
     set the default Start-menu group name

`/COMPONENTS="comma separated list of component names"'
     set the initial list of components: Components are named `main',
     `html', `manuals', `manuals/basic', `manuals/technical',
     `manuals/refman', `manuals/libdocs', `tcl', `tcl/tzdata',
     `tcl/chm', `trans' and `tests'.

It is also possible to save the settings used to a file and later
reload those settings using

`/SAVEINF="filename"'
     save the settings to the specified file.  Don't forget to use
     quotes if the filename contains spaces.

`/LOADINF="filename"'
     instructs the installer to load the settings from the specified
     file after having checked the command line.

A successful installation has exit code 0: unsuccessful ones may give 1,
2, 3, 4 or 5.  See the help for Inno Setup
(`http://jrsoftware.org/ishelp.php') for details.

We have some facilities for building a customized installer, in
particular to add packages to the installer.  See the `R Installation
and Administration' manual in the subsection `Building the installers'.

2.5 How do I run it?
====================

Just double-click on the shortcut you prepared at installation.

If you want to set up another project, make a new shortcut or use the
existing one and change the `Start in' field of the Properties.

You may if you prefer run R from the command line of any shell you use,
for example a `Command Prompt' or a port of a Unix shell such as `tcsh'
or `bash'. (The command line can be anything you would put in the
Target field of a shortcut, and the starting directory will be the
current working directory of the shell.)

2.6 Can I run R from a CD or USB drive?
=======================================

Yes, with care.  A basic R installation is relocatable, so you can burn
an image of the R installation on your hard disc or install directly
onto a removable storage device such as a flash-memory USB drive.

Running R does need access to a writable temporary directory and to a
home directory, and in the last resort these are taken to be the current
directory.  This should be no problem on a properly configured version
of Windows, but otherwise does mean that it may not be possible to run R
without creating a shortcut starting in a writable folder.

2.7 How do I UNinstall R?
=========================

Normally you can do this from the R group on the Start Menu or from the
`Add/Remove Programs' or `Programs and Features' group in the Control
Panel.  If it does not appear there, run `unins000.exe' in the
top-level installation directory.  (There should be a separate
uninstall item in the R group on the Start Menu for each installed
version of R.  On recent versions of Windows you may well be asked to
confirm that you wish to run a program from an `unidentified
publisher'.)

Uninstalling R only removes files from the initial installation, not
(for example) packages you have installed or updated.

If all else fails, you can just delete the whole directory in which R
was installed.

2.8 What's the best way to upgrade?
===================================

That's a matter of taste.  For most people the best thing to do is to
uninstall R (see the previous Q), install the new version, copy any
installed packages to the library folder in the new installation, run
`update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE, ask=FALSE)' in the new R and then
delete anything left of the old installation.  Different versions of R
are quite deliberately installed in parallel folders so you can keep old
versions around if you wish.

For those with a personal library (folder `R\win-library\X.Y' of your
home directory, `R\win64-library\X.Y' on 64-bit builds), you will need
to update that too when the minor version of R changes (e.g. from
2.10.1 to 2.11.0).  A simple way to do so is to copy (say)
`R\win-library\2.10' to `R\win-library\2.11' before running
`update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE, ask=FALSE)'.

2.9 There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!
====================================================

Indeed there is.  It is set by the command-line flag `--max-mem-size'
(*note How do I install R for Windows?::) and defaults to the smaller
of the amount of physical RAM in the machine and 0.5GB less than the
limit of user virtual memory for a process (most often 2GB on a 32-bit
build).  It can be set to any amount between 32Mb and 4095Mb (on a
32-bit build).

Use `?Memory' and `?memory.size' for information about memory usage.
The limit can be raised by calling `memory.limit' within a running R
session.

The 32-bit executables `Rgui.exe' and `Rterm.exe' support up to 3GB of
user address space per process under suitably enabled versions of
32-bit Windows (see
`http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx',
`http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613473%28VS.85%29.aspx';
this is not enabled by default).  On such systems, the default for
`--max-mem-size' is the smaller of the amount of RAM and 2.5GB.  On all
but the earliest 64-bit versions of Windows the user address space for
a 32-bit process is 4GB, and there the default for `--max-mem-size' is
the smaller of the amount of RAM and 3.5GB.  For a 64-bit build, the
default is the amount of RAM.

2.10 How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?
===============================================================================

Create a separate shortcut for each project: see Q2.5.  All the paths to
files used by R are relative to the starting directory, so setting the
`Start in' field automatically helps separate projects.

Alternatively, start R by double-clicking on a saved `.RData' file in
the directory for the project you want to use, or drag-and-drop a file
with extension `.RData' onto an R shortcut.  In either case, the
working directory will be set to that containing the file.

2.11 How do I print from R?
===========================

It depends what you want to print.

   * You can print the graphics window from its menu or by using
     `dev.print' with suitable arguments (see its help page: most likely
     `dev.print(win.graph)' will work).

   * You can print from the R console or pager by `File | Print'.
     (This will print the selection if there is one, otherwise the whole
     console or pager contents.)

   * You can print help files from the pager or HTML browser.

   * If you have LaTeX installed and a PostScript or PDF printing
     system you can print help files by `help(fn_name,
     help_type="postscript")' (or `"PDF"').

2.12 Can I use `R CMD BATCH'?
=============================

Yes: use `R CMD BATCH --help' or `?BATCH' for full details.

You can set also up a batch file using `Rterm.exe'.  A sample batch
file might contain (as one line)

     path_to_R\bin\Rterm.exe --no-restore --no-save < %1 > %1.out 2>&1

The purpose of `2>&1' is to redirect warnings and errors to the same
file as normal output.

2.13 Can I use R-2.11.1 with ESS and (X)emacs?
==============================================

Yes.  ESS has for a long time supported R under Windows: it does so by
running `Rterm.exe' without a visible console.

For help with ESS, please send email to <ESS-help@stat.ethz.ch>, not
the R mailing lists.

2.14 What are HOME and working directories?
===========================================

Several places in the documentation use these terms.

The working directory is the directory from which `Rgui' or `Rterm' was
launched, unless a shortcut was used when it is given by the `Start in'
field of the shortcut's properties.  You can find this from R code by
the call `getwd()'.

The home directory is set as follows: If environment variable `R_USER'
is set, its value is used.  Otherwise if environment variable `HOME' is
set, its value is used.  After those two user-controllable settings, R
tries to find system-defined home directories.  It first tries to use
the Windows "personal" directory (typically `C:\Documents and
Settings\username\My Documents' on Windows XP and
`C:\Users\username\Documents' on Vista).  If that fails, if both
environment variables `HOMEDRIVE' and `HOMEPATH' are set (and they
normally are), the value is `${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}'.  If all of these
fail, the current working directory is used.

You can find this from R code by `Sys.getenv("R_USER")'.

2.15 How do I set environment variables?
========================================

Environment variables can be set for `Rgui.exe' and `Rterm.exe' in
three different ways.
  1. On the command line as name=value pairs.  For example in the
     shortcut to `Rgui' you could have

          "path_to_R\bin\Rgui.exe" HOME=p:/ R_LIBS=p:/myRlib

  2. In an environment file `.Renviron' in the working directory or
     your home directory, for example containing the line

          R_LIBS=p:/myRlib

     If you have permission to do so, you can also create an
     environment file `etc\Renviron.site' and set environmental
     variables in that file in the same way.  This is useful for
     variables which should be set for all users and all usages of this
     R installation.  (Their values can be overridden in a `.Renviron'
     file or on the command line.)

     See `?Startup' for more details of environment files.

  3. For all applications via Windows.  How you set an environment
     variable is system specific: under Windows 2000/XP/2003 you can
     use `System' in the control panel or the properties of `My
     Computer' (under the `Advanced' tab).  Under Vista, go to `User
     Accounts' in the Control Panel, and select your account and then
     `Change my environment variables'.

The order of precedence for environmental variables is the order in
which these options are listed, that is the command line then
`.Renviron' then the inherited environment.

2.16 R can't find my file, but I know it is there!
==================================================

How did you specify it?  Backslashes have to be doubled in R character
strings, so for example one needs
`"d:\\R-2.11.1\\library\\xgobi\\scripts\\xgobi.bat"'.  You can make
life easier for yourself by using forward slashes as path separators:
they do work under Windows.  You should include the file extension
(e.g. `"xgobi.bat"' rather than just `"xgobi"'); sometimes this isn't
shown in Windows, but it is necessary in R.

A simple way to avoid these problems is to use the function
`file.choose()' to invoke the standard Windows file selection dialog.
If you select a file there, the name will be passed to R in the correct
format.

Another possible source of grief is spaces in folder names.  We have
tried to make R work on paths with spaces in, but many people writing
packages for Unix do not bother.  So it is worth trying the alternative
short name (something like `PROGRA~1'; you can get it as the `MS-DOS
name' from the Properties of the file on some versions of Windows, and
from `dir /X' in a `Command Prompt' window), and using the function
`shortPathName' from R code.

2.17 Does R use the Registry?
=============================

Not when R itself is running.

When you run the R installer, there are options (under `Select
Additional Tasks') to `Save version number in registry' and (for
Administrator installs) `Associate R with .RData files'.

If you tick the first option, the following string entries are added to
the Windows registry:
   * `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core\R\Current Version'
     contains the version number, currently 2.11.1.

   * `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core\R\[version]\InstallPath'
     (where `[version]' is currently 2.11.1) contains the path to the R
        home directory.
If you do not have administrative privileges on the machine while
running the installer, then the entries are created under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER'.  As from R 2.11.0 the same entries are also
created under `Software\R-core\R32' or `Software\R-core\R64', for 32-
and 64-bit R respectively.

If you tick the second option (shown with administrative privileges
only) (`Associate R with .RData files') then entries are created under
`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.RData' and `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RWorkspace'.

After installation you can add the Registry entries in by running
`RSetReg.exe' in the `bin' folder, and remove them by running this with
argument `/U'.  Note that this requires administrative privileges
unless run with argument `/Personal' and neither sets up nor removes
the file associations.

2.18 Does R support automation (OLE, COM)?
==========================================

Directly, no.  See CRAN packages `rscproxy' and `rcom' as well as
`RDCOMServer', `RDCOMClient', `RDCOMEvents' and `SWinTypeLibs' from
`http://www.omegahat.org/'.

2.19 The Internet download functions fail.
==========================================

for example `update.packages()' and the menu items on the Packages menu.

We have had several reports of this, although they do work for us on
_all_ of our machines.  There are two known possible fixes.

(a) Use the alternative `internet2.dll' by starting R with the flag
`--internet2' (*note How do I install R for Windows?::) or calling
`setInternet2(TRUE)'.  These cause R to use the Internet Explorer
internals, which may already to configured for use with proxies.  Note
that this does not work with proxies that need authentication.

(b) A proxy needs to be set up: see `?download.file'.  Here are two
versions of an example (a real one, but from a machine that is only
available locally) of a command-line in a short cut:

     "path_to_R\bin\Rgui.exe" http_proxy=http://user:pass@gannet:80/

     "path_to_R\bin\Rgui.exe" http_proxy=http://gannet/ http_proxy_user=ask

The second version will prompt the user for the proxy username and
password when HTTP downloads are first used.

Another possibility is that firewall settings are blocking the R
executables from contacting the Internet, but this should result in
informative error messages from the firewall program.

2.20 Entering certain characters crashes Rgui.
==============================================

This has not been reported for a few years, but used to happen
regularly.  All the occurrences we have solved have been traced to
faulty versions of `msvcrt.dll': we have installed a workaround that
seems to avoid this.  A few other people have discovered this was
caused by desktop switcher and keyboard macro programs, for example
`Macro Magic' and `JS Pager'.

2.21 What does 'DLL attempted to change FPU control word' mean?
===============================================================

This is a _warning_ which indicates that R has taken action to correct
the action of some (non-R) DLL which has just been loaded and has
changed the floating point control word (in its initialization code) to
a setting incompatible with that needed for R.  This is not good
practice on the part of the DLL, and often indicates that it needs to be
updated.

Unfortunately, because DLLs may themselves load other DLLs it is not
possible for R to track which DLL caused the problem.

See also `?dyn.load'.

2.22 Other strange crashes.
===========================

Some users have found that `Rgui.exe' fails to start, exiting with a
"Floating-point invalid operation" or other low level error.  This
error may also happen in the middle of a session.  In some cases where
we have tracked this down, it was due to bugs in the video driver on the
system in question: it makes changes to the floating point control word
which are incompatible with R.  (Good practice would restore the control
word to the state it was in when the driver code was called, and R
tries hard to correct this before running its own code.)  For example,
one user reported that the virtual screen manager JSP2 caused this
crash.

These errors are essentially impossible for us to fix or work around
beyond the measures already taken.  The only solution we know of is for
the user to replace the buggy system component that is causing the
error.

2.23 Why does R never use more than 50% of my CPU?
==================================================

This is a misreading of Windows' confusing Task Manager.  R's
computation is single-threaded, and so it cannot use more than one CPU.
What the task manager shows is not the usage in CPUs (as better written
utilities do) but the usage as a percentage of the apparent total number
of CPUs.  We say `apparent' as it treats so-called `hyperthreaded' CPUs
as two CPUs even though there is only one physical CPU: dual-core CPUs
will also show as two CPUs (which they genuinely are) or more (since
each core can be hyperhreaded).

Many benchmarks show hyperthreading reduces the overall workload, so you
may want to experiment with disabling it.

2.24 Does R run under Windows Vista/7/Server 2008?
==================================================

It does.  A few issues have been reported that related to the way
accounts and file permissions work.  (These are not specifically R
issues, but changes in user experiences.)

Earlier versions of Windows had user and Administrator accounts, and
user accounts could be give administrative privileges (by being added to
the local Administrators group) and so write permission over system
areas such as `c:\Program Files'.  R would be installed either by a
user in his own file space or by an account with administrator
privileges into a system area.  Sysadmins could set policies for user
accounts, and you might for example have needed to be a `Power User' to
install software at all.

Vista normally disables the Administrator account and expects software
installation to done by an account which is in the local Administrator
group with `admin approval mode' turned on.  (The Administrator account
by default has it turned off.)  Unlike (say) Windows XP, such accounts
do not run programs with full administrator privileges, and this is
where the issues arise.  (For background information consult e.g.
`http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/01/23/security-features-vs-convenience.aspx'.)
Vista has the concept of `over-the-shoulder' credentials: if you are
running without full administrator privileges and do something which
needs them you may be prompted with one or more security-check dialog
boxes, and may be required to provide administrator credentials or
confirm that you really want to take that action.

Vista will report that the R installer has an `unidentified publisher'
and ask if it should be run.  System administrators can disable
installing applications from non-trusted sources, in which case you
will have to persuade them that R is trustworthy, or digitally sign the
R installer yourself, or (unless this is also disabled) run the
installer from a standard account and install into your own file area.
(The same issues apply to the `.msi' version of the installer.)

If you install R as a standard user into your own file space and use it
under the same account, there are no known permission issues.

If you use the default Administrator account (without `admin approval
mode' being turned on) and install/update packages (in the system area
or elsewhere), no issues are known.

If you use an account in the local Administrators group in `admin
approval mode' (which is the intended norm under Vista), installation
will make use of `over-the-shoulder' credentials.  You will run into
problems if you try installing (including updating) packages in the
main R library.  (It would be nice if at that point R could use
over-the-shoulder credentials, but they apply to processes as a whole.
Vista disallows creating `.chm' and `.dll' files in the system area
without credentials.)  There are several ways around this.

   * Run R with Administrator privileges in sessions where you want to
     install packages.  (Do so by right-clicking on the R shortcut and
     selecting 'Run as Administrator'.)

   * Transfer ownership of the R installation to the user which
     installed R.  To do so, use the security tab on the `Properties'
     of the top-level R folder and give `Full Control' over this
     directory to the user (not just the Administrator group).

   * Install packages into a different library tree owned by the
     account used to install R.

     For an installation to be used by a single user, the simplest way
     is to make use of a `personal library': *Note I don't have
     permission to write to the R-2.11.1\library directory::.

     For a site installation, you can create a site-wide library
     directory anywhere convenient, and add it to the default package
     search path for all users via `R_LIBS_SITE' in
     `etc\Renviron.site'.  *Note What are HOME and working
     directories?::.  There is a standard location for a site library,
     the `site-library' directory in the top-level R folder (which you
     would need to create with full control for the R installation
     account).  This will be used for installation in preference to the
     main library folder if it exists.

     This approach will not allow you to update the recommended packages
     unless you `Run as administrator': we suggest you use an R session
     running under Administrator privileges when updating those.

Another issue with Vista was that the standard POSIX ways that R uses
(e.g. in `file.info' and `file.access') to look at file permissions no
longer work reliably.  `file.access' was re-written to work with
Windows NT-based security and the new version seems much more reliable
with Vista (but still not 100% correct).

On suitably recent hardware Vista can prevent the execution of code
from data areas via `Data Execution Prevention' (from a tab in System
Properties -> Advanced -> Performance), and sysadmins can turn this on
for all programs.  R runs correctly with DEP enabled.

2.25 Quotes don't come out right on the console/terminal/pager.
===============================================================

R may make use of directional quotes that are not always rendered
correctly by Windows: these are used by default only by `Rgui' in
suitable locales (not Chinese/Japanese/Korean).

Whether these are used in R output (from functions `sQuote' and
`dQuote') is controlled by `getOption("useFancyQuotes")' whose default
is `FALSE' except for the `Rgui' console.  There are two potential
problems with rendering directional quotes.  The first is with running
`Rterm': in European locales the `Windows Command Prompt' is by default
set up to use MS-DOS and not Windows default encodings: this can be
changed via `chcp', with `chcp 1252' being appropriate for Western
European (including English) locales.  The other is that the default
raster fonts only include directional single quotes and not directional
double quotes (which will probably be rendered as a filled rectangle).

Directional quotes will also be used in text help which is normally
displayed in R's internal pager: these may not be rendered correctly in
an external pager.  They are also used in HTML help, where most browsers
use fonts which render them correctly.

The font used can affect whether quotes are rendered correctly.  The
default font in the `Rgui' console and internal pager is `Courier New',
which has directional quotes on all the systems we tried.  `Lucida
Console' has elegant glyphs for directional quotes, but seems rather
light on Windows XP (it looks better than `Courier New' on Vista):
`Consolas' is another font which we often select.  Non-TrueType fonts
such as `Courier' and `FixedSys' lack directional double quotes on all
the systems we tried.

There is a related problem with using `Sweave' output in `Rgui', for
LaTeX needs to be told about the encoding of directional quotes by
including in the LaTeX preamble e.g. (for a Latin-1 locale)

     \usepackage[cp1252]{inputenc}

or their use suppressed by `options(useFancyQuotes=FALSE)'.

2.26 There is no tilde on my keyboard!
======================================

Where tilde does not appear on the main keyboard, it can normally be
accessed by pressing AltGr (the right Alt key) plus some other key.
This is `]' in Canadian (multilingual), German and Scandinavian
layouts, `1' in Eastern Europe, `[' in Portuguese, `4' or `5' in
Spanish, `/' in Francophone Belgian, and so on.  For some keyboards the
uses of AltGr are at
`http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HP052590631033.aspx': you can
explore those for your keyboard via the `On-Screen Keyboard' (under
Accessories, Accessibility on XP).

On all Windows versions you should be able to get tilde by holding the
down the left Alt key and typing 0126 on the numeric keypad, then
releasing the Alt key.

2.27 Can I use R on 64-bit Windows?
===================================

The standard build of R for Windows is a 32-bit executable that will run
on both 32-bit and 64-bit(1) versions of Windows.  64-bit versions of
Windows run 32-bit executables under the WOW (Windows on Windows)
subsystem: they run in almost exactly the same way as on a 32-bit
version of Windows, except that the address limit for the R process is
4GB (rather than 2GB or perhaps 3GB).

As from R 2.11.0 there is a native 64-bit version of R: see the `R
Installation and Administration Manual'.  A binary installer is
available from `http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows64/base/'.  Most
binary packages are available from CRAN or CRANextras (including some
from Omegahat and `Rgraphviz'), but fewer hard-to-install packages are
available than for the standard 32-bit build.  A subset of Bioconductor
packages are available.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) what Windows calls x64 for x86-64 CPUs, not the very rare ia64
Windows for Itanium CPUs.

2.28 Should I run 32-bit or 64-bit R?
=====================================

For most users (especially beginners) we would recommend using the
32-bit build.

The advantage of a native 64-bit application is that it gets a 64-bit
address space and hence can address far more than 4GB (how much depends
on the version of Windows, but in principle 8TB).  This allows a single
process to take advantage of more than 4GB of RAM (if available) and for
R's memory manager to more easily handle large objects (in particular
those of 1GB or more).  The disadvantages are that all the pointers are
8 rather than 4 bytes and so small objects are larger and more data has
to be moved around, and that far less external software is available for
64-bit versions of the OS.

The toolchain (compilers, linkers, ...) used to build 64-bit R is less
mature than that for 32-bit R, but testing so far (and all the CRAN
packages provide an extensive test suite) suggests that they are mature
enough for production use.  The compilers are more recent versions of
GCC with better optimization and are able to take advantage of extra
features of all x86-64 chips (more registers, SSE2/3 instructions, ...)
and so the code may run faster despite using larger pointers.

2.29 Can both 32- and 64-bit R be installed on the same machine?
================================================================

Obviously, only relevant if the machine is running a 64-bit version of
Windows.

Yes, with a little care. For R 2.11.x they should be installed into
different directories: the installer will suggest that the 64-bit build
is installed into, say, `R-2.11.0-x64' and Administrator installs will
default to different paths (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\R' for 32-bit,
`C:\Program Files\R' for 64-bit).  The Start Menu, desktop and quick
launch icons will be named differently, and the versions can be
uninstalled independently.

The default personal library directories are different.  If you set the
library path in a personal (rather than site) startup file it will need
to choose one depending on the build, e.g.

     .libPaths(if(.Machine$sizeof.pointer == 8) "~/Rlibs/x64" else "~/Rlibs/i386")

For many Registry items, 32- and 64-bit programs have different views of
the Registry, but clashes can occur.  The most obvious problem is the
file association, which will use the last installation for which this
option is selected.  The situation with (optionally) recording the
version and install path is complex and may vary by the version of
Windows.  But generally we find that with Administrator installs that
the 32-bit view of the Registry shows the last recorded 32-bit install,
and analogously for the 64-bit view, whereas for a user install the 32-
and 64-bit views are shared and so show the latest recorded
installation.  To circumvent the latter, version information is also
recorded at `Software\R-code\R32' or `Software\R-code\R64' as from R
2.11.0.


3 Languages and Internationalization
************************************

3.1 The installer does not offer my language.
=============================================

Only a limited range of languages is supported (but still wider than
those for which R has translations), currently Brazilian Portuguese,
Catalan, both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch,
Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian and Spanish
(Spain).

3.2 I want R in English (and not in French/Chinese/...)!
========================================================

The default behaviour of R is to try to run in the language you run
Windows in.

Apparently some users want Windows in their native language, but not R.
To do so, set `LANGUAGE=en' as discussed in Q2.2 and Q2.15, or in the
`Rconsole' file.

3.3 I want to run R in Chinese/Japanese/Korean.
===============================================

Windows versions of R support `East Asian' languages with a suitable
copy of Windows - e.g. Western installations of Windows often do not
have such support.

Both `Rterm.exe' and `Rgui.exe' support single- and double-width
characters.  It will be necessary to select suitable fonts in files
`Rconsole' and `Rdevga' (see `?Rconsole' or the comments in the files:
the system versions are in the `etc' folder); in the latter you can
replace `Arial' by `Arial Unicode MS', and we tried `FixedSys' and `MS
Mincho' in `Rconsole'.  (Note that `Rdevga' only applies to Windows
graphics devices and not, say, to `pdf'.)

Note that it is important that the console font uses double-width
characters for all CJK characters (as that is what the width table used
assumes): this is true for the fonts intended for CJK locales but not
for example for Lucida Console or Consolas.

You do need to ensure that R is running in a suitable locale: use
`Sys.getlocale()' to find out.  (CJK users may be used to their
language characters always being available, which is the case for
so-called `Unicode' Windows applications.  However, R is primarily
written for Unix-alikes and is not therefore `Unicode'.)  You can find
suitable locale names from
`http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/html/_crt_language_and_country_strings.asp':
beware that `"Chinese"' is Traditional Chinese (code page 950, Big5)
and `"chs"' is needed for Simplified Chinese (code page 936, GB2312).
Note that this can be rather tricky: on International versions of
Windows XP there are several places to select the language under the
`Regional and Language Options' part of the control panel, and the
appropriate language has to be set under _both_ the `Regional Options'
and `Advanced' tabs.

When using `Rterm' the window in which it is run has to be set up to
use a suitable font (e.g. Lucida Console, not the OEM raster fonts) and
a suitable codepage (which for the Windows Cmd shell can be done by
`chcp').

3.4 I selected English for installation but R runs in Chinese.
==============================================================

Precisely, you selected English *for installation*!  The language of
the installer has nothing to do with the language used to run R: this
is completely standard Windows practice (and necessary as different
users of the computer may use different languages).

The language R uses for menus and messages is determined by the
_locale_: please read the appropriate manual (`R Installation and
Administration') for the details.  You can ensure that R uses English
messages by appending `LANGUAGE=en' to the shortcut you use to start R,
or setting it in the `Rconsole' file.

3.5 I would like to be able to use Japanese fonts.
==================================================

for example, in the console and to annotate graphs.  Similar comments
apply to any non-Western European language.

With suitable fonts, this should just work.  You will need to set MS
Mincho or MS Gothic as the console font to ensure that single- and
double-width characters are handled correctly.  The default graphics
fonts for the `windows()' graphics device can handle most common
Japanese characters, but more specialized fonts may need to be set.
(See Q5.2 for how to set fonts: the console font can also be set from
the `GUI preferences' menu item.)  The help for `windowsFonts' has
examples of selecting Japanese fonts for the `windows()' family of
devices.

In addition, the Hershey vector fonts (see `?Hershey', `?Japanese' and
`demo(Japanese)') can be used on any graphics device to display
Japanese characters.

To use non-Latin-1 characters in the `postscript' graphics device, see
its help page (which also applies to `pdf').

3.6 I don't see characters with accents at the R console, for example in ?text.
===============================================================================

You need to specify a font in `Rconsole' (see Q5.2) that supports the
encoding in use, in Western European languages Latin-1.  This used to
be a problem in earlier versions of Windows, but now it is hard to find
a font which does not.

Support for these characters within `Rterm' depends on the environment
(the terminal window and shell, including locale and codepage settings)
within which it is run as well as the font used by the terminal window.
Those are usually on legacy DOS settings and need to altered.

3.7 The dialog buttons are not translated.
==========================================

In most cases they actually are, but by Windows.  Setting the locale or
the `LANGUAGE' environment variable does not change the Windows setting
of its `UI language'.  Under (international) Windows XP there are three
tabs on the _Regional and Language Options_ applet in the Control
Panel.  The first tab controls the locale, the second the UI and the
third the fonts used for `non-Unicode' programs (but apparently also
for Unicode ones in many cases): see Q3.3.  Vista talks about the 'UI
language' and the 'system locale' for setting the language used for
`non-Unicode' programs.

If you have Windows running completely in say French or Chinese these
settings are likely to be consistent.  However, if you try to run
Windows in one language and R in another, you may find the way Windows
handles internationalization slightly odd.


4 Packages
**********

4.1 Can I install packages into libraries in this version?
==========================================================

Yes, but you will need a lot of tools to do so, unless the author or the
maintainers of the `bin/windows/contrib' section on CRAN have been kind
enough to provide a pre-compiled version for Windows as a `.zip' file,
or the package is a simple one involving no compiled code (and
pre-compiled versions are usually available for simple packages).

You can install pre-compiled packages either from CRAN or from a local
`.zip' file by using `install.packages': see its help page.  There are
menu items on the `Packages' menu to provide a point-and-click
interface to package installation.  The packages for each minor (2.x)
version will be stored in a separate area, so for R 2.11.? the files
are in `bin/windows/contrib/2.11'.  You can try those compiled for
earlier versions (but not before 2.10.0), at your own risk.

Note that the pre-compiled versions on CRAN are unsupported: see
`http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/ReadMe', which also
gives the locations of a few other pre-compiled packages.

If there is not a pre-compiled version or that is not up-to-date or you
prefer compiling from source, read the `R Installation and
Administration' manual section on `Add-on Packages'.  Source packages
which contain no C/C++/Fortran code which needs compilation can simply
be installed by `install.packages(type = "source")' or `R CMD INSTALL
pkgname'.  Otherwise you will need to collect and install several
tools: you can download them via the portal at
`http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/'.  Once you have done so,
just run `R CMD INSTALL pkgname'.  To check the package (including
running all the examples on its help pages and in its test suite, if
any) use `R CMD check pkgname' (which needs Perl installed): see the
_`Writing R Extensions'_ manual.

Note that setting up Windows to install a source package that needs
compilation is rather tricky; please do ensure that you have followed
the instructions *exactly*.  At least 90% of the questions asked are
because people have not done so.

If you have a source package that is known to work on a Unix-alike
system, you can try the automated Windows binary package builder
documented at `http://win-builder.r-project.org'.

4.2 I don't have permission to write to the `R-2.11.1\library' directory.
=========================================================================

You can install packages anywhere and use the environment variable
`R_LIBS' (*note How do I set environment variables?::) to point to the
library location(s).

Suppose your packages are installed in `p:\myRlib'.  Then you can EITHER

     set the environment variable R_LIBS to p:\myRlib before starting R

OR use a package by, e.g.

     library(mypkg, lib.loc="p:/myRlib")

You can also have a personal library, which defaults to the directory
`R\win-library\X.Y' of your home directory for versions X.Y.Z of R.
This location can be changed by setting the environment variable
`R_LIBS_USER', and can be found from inside R by running
`Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")'.  This will only be used if it exists so
you may need to create it: you can use

     dir.create(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER"), recursive = TRUE)

to do so.  If you use `install.packages' and do not have permission to
write to the main or site library, it should offer to create a personal
library for you and install the packages there.  This will also happen
if `update.packages' offers to update packages for you in a library
where you do not have write permission.

There can be additional security issues under Windows Vista and later:
*Note Does R run under Windows Vista?::.  In particular, the detection
that a standard user has suitable permissions appears to be unreliable
under Vista, so we recommend that you do create a personal directory
yourself.

4.3 The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system.
===================================================================

This question applied to the pre-2.10.0 HTML help system, which has been
replaced.

4.4 My functions are not found by the HTML help search system.
==============================================================

This question applied to the pre-2.10.0 search system, which has been
replaced.

4.5 Loading a package fails.
============================

Is the package compiled for this version of R?   Many of the packages
need to be compiled for a fairly recent version.

You can tell the version the package was compiled for by looking at the
`Built:' line in its `DESCRIPTION' file or at the `Version' tab of its
DLL in the `libs' directory.  (Right-click on the DLL in Windows
Explorer and select `Version' tab of the `Properties', or use the
`DLL.version' function inside R.)

For a small number of binary packages you need to install additional
software and have its DLLs in your `PATH'.  Windows will normally give
an informative message about a certain DLL not being found (except on
Windows 2000).  See
`http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/2.11/ReadMe' for a
listing of some of these packages (notably `RGtk2', `rggobi', `rJava',
`rjags' and some of the packages connecting to databases).

4.6 Package TclTk does not work.
================================

For package `tcltk' to work (try `demo(tkdensity)' or `demo(tkttest)'
after `library(tcltk)') you need to have Tcl installed.  This is an
optional part of the installation although it is selected by default.
If the message is
     Tcl/Tk support files were not installed
the optional files were not installed, and you need to go back to the
installer and install them.

Alternatively, if you have the environment variable `MY_TCLTK' set to a
non-empty value, it is assumed that you want to use a different Tcl/Tk
8.5.x installation with the path to its `bin' directory given by value
of `MY_TCLTK', and that this is set up correctly (with `TCL_LIBRARY'
set if needed).  In that case you do not need the Tcl/Tk support files
installed (but they can be).  Note that you do need 8.5.x and not 8.4.x
nor (a pre-release of) 8.6.0.

Several package authors have suggested using ActiveTcl
(`http://www.activestate.com/Products/activetcl/') as a way to get
Tcl/Tk extensions (but the support files do contain the most commonly
used `TkTable' and `BWidget' extensions).  This could be used by
setting (for a default install)

     MY_TCLTK=c:/Tcl/bin

*but* current versions do not contain any extra extensions (although
they may be downloaded via the `Teacup' facility).

4.7 Hyperlinks in HTML sometimes do not work.
=============================================

This question was much more relevant prior to version 2.10.0.

They may still not work between packages installed in different
libraries if the HTTP server has been disabled: the remedy is not to do
that!

4.8 `update.packages()' fails.
==============================

You may not be able to update a package which is in use: Windows `locks'
the package's DLL when it is loaded.  So use `update.packages()' (or
the menu equivalent) in a new session.

If you put `library(foo)' in your `.Rprofile' you will need to start R
with `--vanilla' to be able to update package `foo'.  If you set
`R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES' to include `foo', you will need to unset it
temporarily.

It has been reported that some other software has interfered with the
installation process by preventing the renaming of temporary files,
_Google Desktop_ being a known example.

4.9 How do I add to the list of repositories?
=============================================

as shown in the `Select repositories...' item on the `Packages' menu?

This reads from the tab-delimited file `R_HOME\etc\repositories', which
you can edit, or put a modified copy at `.R\repositories' in your HOME
directory (*note What are HOME and working directories?::).

4.10 Help is not shown for some of the packages
===============================================

This was about Compiled HTML help, which is not supported since R
2.10.0.

4.11 How do I get static HTML pages?
====================================

We presume you want to do this for some special purpose: R's help system
will not make use of them, links across library directories will not
work (unlike R < 2.10.0), ambiguous links will be resolved at install
time and missing links will be broken (previous versions used
JavaScript to look for them at run time).  But if you still want them,
here is how to do it.

Static HTML pages are not part of the binary distribution, so you will
need to install R and/or packages from their sources.  To install just a
few packages with static HTML pages use

     R CMD INSTALL --html PKG1 PKG2 \ldots

To install R itself with static HTML pages change the following line in
file `MkRules'

     # set this to YES to build static HTML help
     BUILD_HTML = NO

and them all packages installed by that build of R will be installed
with static HTML pages.


5 Windows Features
******************

5.1 What should I expect to behave differently from the Unix version of R?
==========================================================================

   * R commands can be interrupted by <Esc> in `Rgui.exe' and
     <Ctrl-break> or <Ctrl-C> in `Rterm.exe': <Ctrl-C> is used for
     copying in the GUI version.

   * Command-line editing is always available, but is simpler than the
     readline-based editing on Unix.  For `Rgui.exe', the menu item
     `Help | Console' will give details.  For `Rterm.exe' see file
     `README.rterm'.

   * Paths to files (e.g. in `source()') can be specified with either
     "/" or "\\".

   * `system()' is slightly different: see its help page and that of
     `shell()'.

5.2 I hear about some nifty features: please tell me about them!
================================================================

You have read the file `README.R-2.11.1'? There are file menus on the R
console, pager and graphics windows.  You can source and save from
those menus, and copy the graphics to `png', `jpeg', `bmp',
`postscript', `PDF' or `metafile'.  There are right-click menus giving
shortcuts to menu items, and optionally toolbars with buttons giving
shortcuts to frequent operations.

If you resize the R console the `options(width=)' is automatically set
to the console width (unless disabled in the configuration file).

The graphics has a history mechanism.  As `README.R-2.11.1' says:

     `The History menu allows the recording of plots.  When plots have
     been recorded they can be reviewed by <PgUp> and <PgDn>, saved and
     replaced.  Recording can be turned on automatically (the Recording
     item on the list) or individual plots can be added (Add or the
     <INS> key).  The whole plot history can be saved to or retrieved
     from an R variable in the global environment.    The format of
     recorded plots may change between R versions.    Recorded plots
     should *not* be used as a permanent   storage format for R plots.

     There is only one graphics history shared by all the windows
     devices.'

The R console and graphics windows have configuration files stored in
the `RHOME\etc' directory called `Rconsole' and `Rdevga'; you can keep
personal copies in your `HOME' directory.  They contain comments which
should suffice for you to edit them to your preferences.  For more
details see `?Rconsole'.  There is a GUI preferences editor invoked
from the `Edit' menu which can be used to edit the file `Rconsole'.

5.3 Circles appear as ovals on screen.
======================================

The graphics system asks Windows for the number of pixels per inch in
the X and Y directions, and uses that to size graphics (which in R are
in units of inches).  Sometimes the answer is a complete invention, and
in any case Windows will not know exactly how the horizontal and
vertical size have been set on a CRT.  You can specify correct values
either in the call to `windows' or as options: see `?windows'.
(Typically these are of the order of 100.)

On one of our systems, the screen height was reported as 240mm, and the
width as 300mm in 1280 x 1024 mode and 320mm in 1280 x 960 and 1600 x
1200 modes.  In fact it was a 21" monitor and 400mm x 300mm!

5.4 How do I move focus to a graphics window or the console?
============================================================

You may want to do this from within a function, for example when calling
`identify' or `readline'.  Use the function `bringToTop()'.  With its
default argument it brings the active graphics window to the top and
gives it focus.  With argument `-1' it brings the console to the top
and gives it focus.

This works for `Rgui.exe' in MDI and SDI modes, and can be used for
graphics windows from `Rterm.exe' (although Windows may not always act
on it).

5.5 What does TAB completion do?
================================

Both `Rgui' and `Rterm' support `TAB' completion.  Hitting `TAB' whilst
entering a command line completes the current `word' as far as is
unambiguously possible.  Hitting `TAB' a second time then shows a list
of possible completions (or the first few if there are many): the user
can then enter one or more characters and hit `TAB' again.

What is it `completing'?  There are two modes: within an unterminated
(single- or double-) quoted expression it completes file paths.
Otherwise, it is completing R expressions: most obviously it will match
visible R object names and keywords, so `apr' folloed by `TAB' will (in
a vanilla session) complete to `apropos'.  After a function name and
parenthesis (e.g. `apropos(') it will complete argument names (and
`='), and after `$' or `@' it will complete list components or slot
names respectively.

This feature can be turned off: `Rgui' has two menu items to do so, and
setting the environment variable `R_COMPLETION' to `FALSE' turns it off
completely for both `Rgui' and `Rterm'.  Further, the behaviour can be
fine-tuned: to see the settings available use

     ?rc.settings

which also explains how the various types of completion work.

This feature is very similar to the completion available in the
`readline'-based command line interface on Unix-alikes: the Mac OS X
GUI `R.app' has a different completion scheme.


6 Workspaces
************

6.1 My workspace gets saved in a strange place: how do I stop this?
===================================================================

Have you changed the working directory?: see Q6.2.

6.2 How do I store my workspace in a different place?
=====================================================

Use the `File | Change Dir...' menu item to select a new working
directory: this defaults to the last directory you loaded a file from.
The workspace is saved in the working directory.  You can also save a
snapshot of the workspace from the `Save Workspace...' menu item.

From the command line you can change the working directory by the
function `setwd': see its help page.

6.3 Can I load workspaces saved under Unix/GNU-Linux or Mac OS?
===============================================================

Yes.  All ports of R use the same format for workspaces, so they are
interchangeable (for the same 2.x.? version of R, at least).

Note though that character data in a workspace will be in a particular
encoding that is not recorded in the workspace, so workspaces containing
non-ASCII character data may not be interchangeable even on the same OS.
Since R marks character data when it knows it to be in UTF-8 or Latin-1
(including its Windows superset, CP1252), strings in those encodings are
likely to be transferred correctly: fortunately this covers most of the
common cases (Mac OS X normally uses UTF-8, and Linux users are likely
to use UTF-8 or perhaps Latin-1 (which used to be used for English)).


7 The R Console
***************

7.1 When using Rgui the output to the console seems to be delayed.
==================================================================

This is deliberate: the console output is buffered and re-written in
chunks to be faster and less distracting.  You can turn buffering off or
on from the `Misc' menu or the right-click menu: <Ctrl-W> toggles the
setting.

If you are sourcing R code or writing from a function, there is another
option.  A call to the R function `flush.console()' will write out the
buffer and so update the console.

7.2 Long lines in the console or pager are truncated.
=====================================================

They only *seem* to be truncated: that $ at the end indicates you can
scroll the window to see the rest of the line.  Use the horizontal
scrollbar or the <CTRL + left/right arrow> keys to scroll horizontally.
(The <left/right arrow> keys work in the pager too.)


8 Building from Source
**********************

8.1 How can I compile R from source?
====================================

To build R on 32-bit Windows you will need the tools from
`http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/' as well as some others.
See the `R Installation and Administration' manual.

To build a 64-bit version on 64-bit Windows you will need a suitable
compiler, and the MinGW-w64 port of `binutils' and `gcc' is finally
mature enough to produce a working version of R, so support has been
added as from R 2.11.0: see the manual.  You are welcome to try a
commercial compiler(1), and pre-compiled versions using such compilers
are available from R redistributors.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) such as those from Intel and PGI: there is no Fortran compiler in
the Microsoft set, but `f2c' could be used.

8.2 Can I use a fast BLAS?
==========================

Fast BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms,
`http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html') routines are used to speed up
numerical linear algebra.  There is support in the R sources for the
`tuned' BLAS called ATLAS (`http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net').  The
savings can be appreciable: on a 2.6GHz P4 and a 1000 x 1000 matrix
`svd' took 16.2 sec with the standard BLAS and 7.8 sec with ATLAS.
Because ATLAS is tuned to a particular chip we can't use it generally:
the optimal routines for a P4 or an Athlon XP are quite different and
neither will run at all on a PII.

BLAS support is supplied by the single DLL `R_HOME\bin\Rblas.dll', and
you can add a fast BLAS just by replacing that.  Replacements for some
of the older common chips are available on CRAN in directory
`bin/windows/contrib/ATLAS'.  See the R Installation and
Administration' manual for how to build an ATLAS `Rblas.dll' tuned to
your system using the R sources.  Unfortunately the process has been
less successful when tried for the common current chips such as Core 2.

8.3 How do I include compiled C code?
=====================================

We strongly encourage you to do this _via_ building an R package: see
the _`Writing R Extensions'_ manual.  In any event you should install
the parts of the R system for building R packages (installed by
default), and get and install the tools and compilers mentioned in the
`R Installation and Administration' manual.  Then you can use
     ...\bin\R CMD SHLIB foo.c bar.f
to make `foo.dll'.  Use `...\bin\R CMD SHLIB --help' for further
options, or see `?SHLIB'.

If you want to use Visual C++, Borland C++ or other compilers, see the
appropriate section in `README.packages'.

8.4 How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?
=============================================================

You will need a suitable version of `gdb': we normally use that from
the Cygwin distribution.  Debugging under Windows is often a fraught
process, and sometimes does not work at all.  If all you need is a
_just-in-time_ debugger to catch crashes, consider `Dr. Mingw' from the
`mingw-utils' bundle on `http://www.mingw.org'.  That will be able to
pinpoint the error, most effectively if you build a version of R with
debugging information as described below.

First, build a version of the R system with debugging information by

     make clean
     make DEBUG=T

and make a debug version of your package by either

     make pkgclean-mypkg
     make DEBUG=T pkg-mypkg

or

     Rcmd install -c mypkg
     set DEBUG=T
     Rcmd install mypkg

Then you can debug by

     gdb /path/to/R-2.11.1/bin/Rgui.exe

However, note

   * `gdb' will only be able to find the source code if we run in the
     location where the source was compiled (`R-2.11.1/src/gnuwin32' for
     the main system, `R-2.11.1/src/library/mypkg/src' for a package),
     unless told otherwise by the `directory' command.  It is most
     convenient to set a list of code locations via `directory' commands
     in the file `.gdbinit' in the directory from which `gdb' is run.

   * It is only possible to set breakpoints in a DLL after the DLL has
     been loaded.  So a way to examine the function `tukeyline' in
     package `stats' might be

               gdb ../../../../bin/Rgui.exe
               (gdb) break WinMain
               (gdb) run
               [ stops with R.dll loaded ]
               (gdb) break R_ReadConsole
               (gdb) continue
               [ stops with console running ]
               (gdb) continue
               Rconsole> library(stats)
               (gdb) break tukeyline
               (gdb) clear R_ReadConsole
               (gdb) continue
               Rconsole> example(line)
               ...

     Alternatively, in Rgui you can use the `Misc|Break to debugger'
     menu item after your DLL is loaded.  The C function call
     `breaktodebugger()' will do the same thing.

   * Fortran symbols need an underline appended.

   * Windows has little support for signals, so the Unix idea of
     running a program under a debugger and sending it a signal to
     interrupt it and drop control back to the debugger does not work
     with a MinGW version of `gdb'.  It does often work with the
     `cygwin' version.

   * Other debuggers than `gdb' can be used.  We have successfully used
     the `insight' front-end to `gdb' (see
     `http://sources.redhat.com/insight/': there is a MinGW port on
     their site), and Borland's debugger with a DLL compiled in a
     Borland compiler.


See
`http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/software/debuggingR/gdb.shtml'
for some further details.

8.5 How do I include C++ code?
==============================

You need to do two things:

(a) Write a wrapper to export the symbols you want to call from R as
`extern "C"'.

(b) Include the C++ libraries in the link to make the DLL.  Suppose
`X.cc' contains your C++ code, and `X_main.cc' is the wrapper, as in
the example in _`Writing R Extensions'_.  Then build the DLL by (`gcc')

     ...\bin\R CMD SHLIB X.cc X_main.cc

or (VC++, which requires extension `.cpp')

     cl /MT /c X.cpp X_main.cpp
     link /dll /out:X.dll /export:X_main X.obj X_main.obj

or (Borland C++, which also requires extension `.cpp')

     bcc32 -u- -WDE X.cpp X_main.cpp

and call the entry point(s) in `X_R', such as `X_main'.  Construction
of static variables will occur when the DLL is loaded, and destruction
when the DLL is unloaded, usually when R terminates.

Note that you will not see the messages from this example in the GUI
console: see the next section.

This example used to be in package `cxx_0.0-x.tar.gz' in the
`src/contrib/Devel' section on CRAN, and could be compiled as a package
in the usual way on Windows.

8.6 The output from my C code disappears.  Why?
===============================================

The `Rgui.exe' console is a Windows application: writing to `stdout' or
`stderr' will not produce output in the console.  (This will work with
`Rterm.exe'.)  Use `Rprintf' or `REprintf' instead.  These are declared
in header file `R_ext/PrtUtil.h'.

Note that output from the console is delayed (*note The output to the
console seems to be delayed::), so that you will not normally see any
output before returning to the R prompt.

8.7 The output from my Fortran code disappears.  Why?
=====================================================

Writing to Fortran output writes to a file, not the `Rgui' console.
Use one of the subroutines `dblepr', `intpr' or `realpr' documented in
the _`Writing R Extensions'_ manual.

Note that output from the console is delayed (*note The output to the
console seems to be delayed::), so that you will not normally see any
output before returning to the R prompt even when using the `xxxpr'
subroutines.

8.8 The console freezes when my compiled code is running.
=========================================================

The console, pagers and graphics window all run in the same thread as
the R engine.  To allow the console etc to respond to Windows events,
call `R_ProcessEvents()' periodically from your compiled code.  If you
want output to be updated on the console, call `R_FlushConsole()' and
then `R_ProcessEvents()'.
